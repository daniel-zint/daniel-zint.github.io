My name is Daniel Zint and I am currently affiliated as Postdoctoral Researcher under supervision of [Marc Alexa](https://www.cg.tu-berlin.de/people/marc-alexa).
My research is centered in geometry processing, more precisely mesh generation for numerical and graphical applications. I am interested in all parts of the mesh generation pipeline: pre-processing and simplifying input data, generating triangle and tetrahedral meshes, post-processing with smoothing and topological optimization. During my PhD, I focused on the automatic generation of block-structured meshes that are used in ocean simulations based on the shallow water equations. Currently, I am focusing on robust volumetric meshing for simulations.
